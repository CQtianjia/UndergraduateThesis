Multi-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Formation Control Technology (Undergraduate thesis)

September, 2016 â€“ June, 2017

- Implemented the Camshift Algorithm and Kalman filtering on OpenCV to track the moving object robots and collect their motion information

- Used the A* Algorithm to predict the dynamic paths from the controlled UAVs to each object robot

- Simplified the problem into Multiple Travelling Salesman Problem (mTSP) added with many constraints considering obstacle avoidance, the dynamic change of environment and so on

- Adjusted Ant Colony Optimization with minimum spanning tree of the degree limit to realize the depth-first traversal of the task sequence, so as to realize the multi-UAV mission planning
